Submission 2b:

You should run SimpleTransaction.java. TxInfo will print debug output whenever it started, a TxObject is added to TxInfo,
and a TxObject is updated. In this case, you should see that for each thread, TxInfo started exactly once, got updated 5
times (to 1,2,3,4,5), get the updated value for TxObject exactly once and eventually the final TxObject value without 
committing is still 0. This proves that TxInfo is doing the lazy buffering without changing the TxObject value.
